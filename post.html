            <h2>Dont' Be Tardy For The Peach Party!</h2>
            <p class="meta smaller">Emily - December 21 - Makeup</p>
            <p class="entry-text">Its finally back! The Two Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette is back! You do not want to be tardy for this one! Its time to discuss all the rage that is this palette and what it has to offer!

                Scent
                First, lets talk about this beautiful scent. It smells delightful! It literally smells just like a peach tree. It’s a very light scent, not too heavy but no too light to where you cant smell it.
                
                Color
                The colors are beautiful. Definitely very peachy as expected. They work together perfectly! Definitely a more spring toned palette if you ask me but if you are a makeup junkie like me, then it really doesn’t matter what the season is haha
                
                Pigmentation
                
                Pigmentation is spot on, as most of the Too Faced palettes are. I was a little disappointed by the shade “Talk Derby To Me.” I feel like it faded off by the end of the day even though it is a darker shade. Though I haven’t used every single shade yet, the ones that I have used, have been on point!
                
                Final Thoughts
                This palette is totally worth every penny. Between the scent, the colors and the pigmentation, I cant decide which is the best part about the palette. Definitely go check out this palette!
